# Sensory and Genomics Data Analysis workshop (Binder-ready)

This repository contains the training material and references for the
Sensory and Genomics Data Analysis Workshop delivered by partners in the
**Genetics of Fruit Sensory Preferences** Hort Innovation project
(AS19003), led by [Heather Smyth](mailto:h.smyth@uq.edu.au) (QAAFI, UQ),
[Natalie Dillon](mailto:natalie.dillon@daf.qld.gov.au) (QDAF) and [Ido
Bar](mailto:i.bar@griffith.edu.au) (Griffith University).  
It is designed for students and researchers who wish to learn how to
analyse, visualise and combine sensory and genetic/genomic datasets.

The teaching materials for the workshops were developed by Dr. Ido Bar
(<i.bar@griffith.edu.au>) and Josh Lomax
(<josh.lomax@griffithuni.edu.au>) and are based on our own experience
and publicly available online resources.  
The tutorials are designed to be run interactively as “live-coding” in
class either locally on the participants’ computers or using
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (see instructions below).
