  abstract = {Graphical models are a powerful tool in modelling and analysing complex biological associations in high-dimensional data. The R-package netgwas implements the recent methodological development on copula graphical models to (i) construct linkage maps, (ii) infer linkage disequilibrium networks from genotype data, and (iii) detect high-dimensional genotype-phenotype networks. The netgwas learns the structure of networks from ordinal data and mixed ordinal-and-continuous data. Here, we apply the functionality in netgwas to various multivariate example datasets taken from the literature to demonstrate the kind of insight that can be obtained from the package. We show that our package offers a more realistic association analysis than the classical approaches, as it discriminates between direct and induced correlations by adjusting for the effect of all other variables while performing pairwise associations. This feature controls for spurious interactions between variables that can arise from conventional approaches in a biological sense. The netgwas package uses a parallelization strategy on multi-core processors to speed-up computations. The netgwas package is freely available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netgwas},

  abstract = {Genomic prediction tools support crop breeding based on statistical methods, such as the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP). However, these tools are not designed to capture non-linear relationships within multi-dimensional datasets, or deal with high dimension datasets such as imagery collected by unmanned aerial vehicles. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to surpass the prediction accuracy of current tools used for genotype to phenotype prediction, due to their capacity to autonomously extract data features and represent their relationships at multiple levels of abstraction. This review addresses the challenges of applying statistical and machine learning methods for predicting phenotypic traits based on genetic markers, environment data, and imagery for crop breeding. We present the advantages and disadvantages of explainable model structures, discuss the potential of machine learning models for genotype to phenotype prediction in crop breeding, and the challenges, including the scarcity of high-quality datasets, inconsistent metadata annotation and the requirements of ML models.},

Genomic prediction goes a step further, attempting to predict phenotypic variation in these traits from genomic information. Genome-Wide Association Studies and Genomic Prediction pulls together expert contributions to address this important area of study. The volume begins with a section covering the phenotypes of interest as well as design issues for GWAS, then moves on to discuss efficient computational methods to store and handle large datasets, quality control measures, phasing, haplotype inference, and imputation. Later chapters deal with statistical approaches to data analysis where the experimental objective is either to confirm the biology by identifying genomic regions associated to a trait or to use the data to make genomic predictions about a future phenotypic outcome (e.g. predict onset of disease). As part of the Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters provide helpful, real-world implementation advice.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci that underpin the complex biology of many human traits. However, the strength of GWAS -- the ability to detect genetic association by linkage disequilibrium (LD) -- is also its limitation. Whilst the ever-increasing study size and improved design have augmented the power of GWAS to detect effects, differentiation of causal variants or genes from other highly correlated genes associated by LD remains the real challenge. This has severely hindered the biological insights and clinical translation of GWAS findings. Although thousands of disease susceptibility loci have been reported, causal genes at these loci remain elusive. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer an opportunity to dissect the heterogeneity of variant and gene signals in the post-GWAS analysis phase. ML models for GWAS prioritization vary greatly in their complexity, ranging from relatively simple logistic regression approaches to more complex ensemble models such as random forests and gradient boosting, as well as deep learning models, i.e., neural networks. Paired with functional validation, these methods show important promise for clinical translation, providing a strong evidence-based approach to direct post-GWAS research. However, as ML approaches continue to evolve to meet the challenge of causal gene identification, a critical assessment of the underlying methodologies and their applicability to the GWAS prioritization problem is needed. This review investigates the landscape of ML applications in three parts: selected models, input features, and output model performance, with a focus on prioritizations of complex disease associated loci. Overall, we explore the contributions ML has made towards reaching the GWAS end-game with consequent wide-ranging translational impact.},

The implementation allows users to include an arbitrary number of random-effects terms. For each set of predictors, users can choose diffuse, Gaussian, and Gaussian--spike--slab multivariate priors. Unlike other software packages for multitrait genomic regressions, BGLR offers many specifications for (co)variance parameters (unstructured, diagonal, factor analytic, and recursive). Samples from the posterior distribution of the models implemented in the multitrait function are generated using a Gibbs sampler, which is implemented by combining code written in the R and C programming languages. In this article, we provide an overview of the models and methods implemented BGLR's multitrait function, present examples that illustrate the use of the package, and benchmark the performance of the software.},

Implementing these large-p-with-small-n regressions poses several statistical and computational challenges, some of which can be confronted using Bayesian methods. This approach allows integrating various parametric and nonparametric shrinkage and variable selection procedures in a unified and consistent manner. The BGLR R-package implements a large collection of Bayesian regression models, including parametric variable selection and shrinkage methods and semiparametric procedures (Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions, RKHS). The software was originally developed for genomic applications; however, the methods implemented are useful for many nongenomic applications as well. The response can be continuous (censored or not) or categorical (either binary or ordinal). The algorithm is based on a Gibbs sampler with scalar updates and the implementation takes advantage of efficient compiled C and Fortran routines. In this article we describe the methods implemented in BGLR, present examples of the use of the package, and discuss practical issues emerging in real-data analysis.},

Due to the great magnitude and complexity of genomic and phenotypic data, analytical methods and their associated software packages are frequently advanced. GAPIT is a widely-used genomic association and prediction integrated tool as an R package. The first version was released to the public in 2012 with the implementation of the general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), compressed MLM (CMLM), and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP). The second version was released in 2016 with several new implementations, including enriched CMLM (ECMLM) and settlement of MLMs under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER). All the GWAS methods are based on the single-locus test. For the first time, in the current release of GAPIT, version 3 implemented three multi-locus test methods, including multiple loci mixed model (MLMM), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK). Additionally, two GP/GS methods were implemented based on CMLM (named compressed BLUP; cBLUP) and SUPER (named SUPER BLUP; sBLUP). These new implementations not only boost statistical power for GWAS and prediction accuracy for GP/GS, but also improve computing speed and increase the capacity to analyze big genomic data. Here, we document the current upgrade of GAPIT by describing the selection of the recently developed methods, their implementations, and potential impact.

Developing newly advanced statistical models to improve accuracy in predicting and locating for the traits with various genetic architectures has always been a hot topic in those two research domains. The Bayesian regression model (BRM) has played a crucial role in the past decade, and it has been used widely in relevant genetic analyses owing to its flexible model assumptions on the unknown genetic architecture of complex traits. To fully utilize the available data from either a self-designed experimental population or a public database, statistical geneticists have constantly extended the fitting capacity of BRM, and a series of new methodologies have been proposed for different application scenarios. Here we introduce             hibayes             , which is the only one tool that can implement three types of Bayesian regression models. With the richest methods achieved thus far, it covers almost all the functions involved in genetic analyses for genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies, potentially addressing a wide range of research problems, while retaining an easy-to-use and transparent interface.

  abstract = {A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is currently one of the most recommended approaches for discovering marker-trait associations (MTAs) for complex traits in plant species. Insufficient statistical power is a limiting factor, especially in narrow genetic basis species, that conventional GWAS methods are suffering from. Using sophisticated mathematical methods such as machine learning (ML) algorithms may address this issue and advance the implication of this valuable genetic method in applied plant-breeding programs. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of two ML algorithms, support-vector machine (SVR) and random forest (RF), in a GWAS and compared them with two conventional methods of mixed linear models (MLM) and fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), for identifying MTAs for soybean-yield components. In this study, important soybean-yield component traits, including the number of reproductive nodes (RNP), non-reproductive nodes (NRNP), total nodes (NP), and total pods (PP) per plant along with yield and maturity, were assessed using a panel of 227 soybean genotypes evaluated at two locations over two years (four environments). Using the SVR-mediated GWAS method, we were able to discover MTAs colocalized with previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) with potential causal effects on the target traits, supported by the functional annotation of candidate gene analyses. This study demonstrated the potential benefit of using sophisticated mathematical approaches, such as SVR, in a GWAS to complement conventional GWAS methods for identifying MTAs that can improve the efficiency of genomic-based soybean-breeding programs.},
