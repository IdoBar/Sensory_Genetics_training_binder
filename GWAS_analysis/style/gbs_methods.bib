  abstract = {Although vast technological advances have been made and genetic software packages are growing in number, it is not a trivial task to analyse SNP data. We announce a new r package, dartr, enabling the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data for population genomic and phylogenomic applications. dartr provides user-friendly functions for data quality control and marker selection, and permits rigorous evaluations of conformation to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, gametic-phase disequilibrium and neutrality. The package reports standard descriptive statistics, permits exploration of patterns in the data through principal components analysis and conducts standard F-statistics, as well as basic phylogenetic analyses, population assignment, isolation by distance and exports data to a variety of commonly used downstream applications (e.g., newhybrids, faststructure and phylogeny applications) outside of the r environment. The package serves two main purposes: first, a user-friendly approach to lower the hurdle to analyse such data-therefore, the package comes with a detailed tutorial targeted to the r beginner to allow data analysis without requiring deep knowledge of r. Second, we use a single, well-established format-genlight from the adegenet package-as input for all our functions to avoid data reformatting. By strictly using the genlight format, we hope to facilitate this format as the de facto standard of future software developments and hence reduce the format jungle of genetic data sets. The dartr package is available via the r CRAN network and GitHub.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The advance of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies allows high-throughput genotyping at a reasonable cost, although, in the case of peach, this technology has been scarcely developed. To date, only a standard Genotyping by Sequencing approach (GBS), based on a single restriction with ApeKI to reduce genome complexity, has been applied in peach. In this work, we assessed the performance of the double-digest RADseq approach (ddRADseq), by testing 6 double restrictions with the restriction profile generated with ApeKI. The enzyme pair PstI/MboI retained the highest number of loci in concordance with the in silico analysis. Under this condition, the analysis of a diverse germplasm collection (191 peach genotypes) yielded 200,759,000 paired-end (2\,\texttimes\,250~bp) reads that allowed the identification of 113,411 SNP, 13,661 InDel and 2133 SSR. We take advantage of a wide sample set to describe technical scope of the platform. The novel platform presented here represents a useful tool for genomic-based breeding for peach.},

Using this methodology, we investigated the genomic diversity of a panel of 288 diverse tomato (               Solanum lycopersicum               L.) accessions enriched in `da serbo' (called `de penjar' in Spain) long shelf life (LSL) materials (152 accessions) mostly originating from Italy and Spain. The rest of the materials originate from different countries and include landraces for fresh consumption, elite cultivars, heirlooms, and breeding lines. Apart from their LSL trait, `da serbo' landraces are of remarkable interest for their resilience. We identified 32,799 high-quality SNPs, which were used for model ancestry population structure and non-parametric hierarchical clustering. Six genetic subgroups were revealed, clearly separating most `da serbo' landraces, but also the Spanish germplasm, suggesting a subdivision of the population based on type and geographical provenance. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the collection decayed very rapidly within {$<$}5\,kb. We then investigated SNPs showing contrasted minor frequency allele (MAF) in `da serbo' materials, resulting in the identification of high frequencies in this germplasm of several mutations in genes related to stress tolerance and fruit maturation such as               CTR1               and               JAR1               . Finally, a mini-core collection of 58 accessions encompassing most of the diversity was selected for further exploitation of key traits. Our findings suggest the presence of a genetic footprint of the `da serbo' germplasm selected in the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, we provide novel insights on LSL `da serbo' germplasm as a promising source of alleles for tolerance to stresses.},

  abstract = {To minimize the cost of sample preparation and genotyping, most genebank genomics studies in self-pollinating species are conducted on a single individual to represent an accession, which may be heterogeneous with larger than expected intra-accession genetic variation. Here, we compared various population genetics parameters among six DNA (leaf) sampling methods on 90 accessions representing a wild species (O. barthii), cultivated and landraces (O. glaberrima, O. sativa), and improved varieties derived through interspecific hybridizations. A total of 1,527 DNA samples were genotyped with 46,818 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using DArTseq. Various statistical analyses were performed on eleven datasets corresponding to 5 plants per accession individually and in a bulk (two sets), 10 plants individually and in a bulk (two sets), all 15 plants individually (one set), and a randomly sampled individual repeated six times (six sets). Overall, we arrived at broadly similar conclusions across 11 datasets in terms of SNP polymorphism, heterozygosity/heterogeneity, diversity indices, concordance among genetic dissimilarity matrices, population structure, and genetic differentiation; there were, however, a few discrepancies between some pairs of datasets. Detailed results of each sampling method, the concordance in their outputs, and the technical and cost implications of each method were discussed.},

  abstract = {In the last 20 years, we have observed an exponential growth of the DNA sequence data and simular increase in the volume of DNA polymorphism data generated by numerous molecular marker technologies. Most of the investment, and therefore progress, concentrated on human genome and genomes of selected model species. Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT), developed over a decade ago, was among the first "democratizing" genotyping technologies, as its performance was primarily driven by the level of DNA sequence variation in the species rather than by the level of financial investment. DArT also proved more robust to genome size and ploidy-level differences among approximately 60 organisms for which DArT was developed to date compared to other high-throughput genotyping technologies. The success of DArT in a number of organisms, including a wide range of "orphan crops," can be attributed to the simplicity of underlying concepts: DArT combines genome complexity reduction methods enriching for genic regions with a highly parallel assay readout on a number of "open-access" microarray platforms. The quantitative nature of the assay enabled a number of applications in which allelic frequencies can be estimated from DArT arrays. A typical DArT assay tests for polymorphism tens of thousands of genomic loci with the final number of markers reported (hundreds to thousands) reflecting the level of DNA sequence variation in the tested loci. Detailed DArT methods, protocols, and a range of their application examples as well as DArT's evolution path are presented.},

  abstract = {We present an improved ddRAD-Seq protocol for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It utilizes selected restriction enzyme digestion fragments, quick acting ligases that are neutral with the restriction enzyme buffer eliminating buffer exchange steps, and adapters designed to be compatible with Illumina index primers. Library amplification and barcoding are completed in one PCR step, and magnetic beads are used to purify the genomic fragments from the ligation and library generation steps. Our protocol increases the efficiency and decreases the time to complete a ddRAD-Seq experiment. To demonstrate its utility, we compared SNPs from our protocol with those from whole genome resequencing data from Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium arboreum. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the variability of the combined data was explained by the genotype (PC1) and methodology applied (PC2). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SNPs from our method clustered with SNPs from the resequencing data of the corresponding genotype. Sequence alignments illustrated that for homozygous loci, more than 90\% of the SNPs from the resequencing data were discovered by our method. Our analyses suggest that our ddRAD-Seq method is reliable in identifying SNPs suitable for phylogenetic and association genetic studies while reducing cost and time over known methods.},

Here we present RADpainter, a new program designed to infer the coancestry matrix from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data. We combine this program together with a previously published MCMC clustering algorithm into fineRADstructure - a complete, easy to use, and fast population inference package for RADseq data (https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure).

Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (1) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci, and; (2) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and SNPs. As an empirical example we use a double digest RAD dataset of a non-model plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high altitude mountains in Mexico.},

However, one major concern of these types of markers is the precision of genotyping, which is related to the common problem of missing data, which appears to be particularly important in association and genomic selection studies. We evaluated three RRL approaches (GBS, RADseq, ddRAD) and different SNP identification methods (de novo or based on a reference genome) to find the best solutions for future population genomics studies in two economically and ecologically important broadleaved tree species, namely F. sylvatica and Q. robur. We found that the use of ddRAD method coupled with SNP calling based on reference genomes provided the largest numbers of markers (28 k and 36 k for beech and oak, respectively), given standard filtering criteria. Using technical replicates of samples, we demonstrated that more than 80\% of SNP loci should be considered as reliable markers in GBS and ddRAD, but not in RADseq data. According to the reference genomes' annotations, more than 30\% of the identified ddRAD loci appeared to be related to genes. Our findings provide a solid support for using ddRAD-based SNPs for future population genomics studies in beech and oak.},
